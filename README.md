**DARK PATTERNS DETECTION EXTENSION**


Dark Patterns refers to the manipulative elements on e-commerce websites that convince users to take decisions that they wouldn't take otherwise. 
The dark pattern recognition system highlights such elements so that the users can avoid them.

It uses the Binomial Naive Bayes Algorithm to identify whether an element is a dark pattern  or not and Multinomial Naive Bayes to classify the type  of dark pattern.
